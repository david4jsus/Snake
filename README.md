# Snake
My take on learning how to program the classic arcade game "Snake".

The code for the game is in the javascript file, while the html file holds the script in the canvas tag. The code is fully commented for future reference and in case any other person wants to learn what is going on in the code.

A playable version of this game will be available on my github site "david4jsus.github.io".
